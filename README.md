# Airship
Airship is a Python-based program to synchronize game saves between clouds, such as iCloud (for iOS) and Steam Cloud (for Steam).

## Downloading and installing

Before installing and running Airship, you must install these dependencies.

- All functionality depends on having Python version 2.7 or above installed. Your operating system may have Python installed already; to check, type `python -V` into your terminal or command line. Otherwise, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads).
- It is recommended to install Airship through `pip`. [Download `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing.html#install-pip).
- Steam Cloud functionality depends on having Steam installed, logged in, and running while Airship is running. [Download Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about).
- iCloud functionality depends on running Airship on OS X 10.10 Yosemite or above, being logged into iCloud, and having iCloud Drive synchronization enabled in System Preferences.

Download the latest release by running `pip install airship` and adding appropriate modules (like `pip install airship airship-steamcloud airship-icloud`).
